//List of the data structures  & sorting algorithms I am not  familiar yet
1. Heap Sort: I find it hard because I'm not good at heap data structures
2. Shell Sort:  I get lost around gap shorts
3. Cocktail Shaker Sort: I didn't understand anything about the left and right shorting
4. Sleep Sort: I find the logic here to be unusual!
